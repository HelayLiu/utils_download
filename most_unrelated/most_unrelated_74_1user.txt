- As an operator, I want to fill orders securely, with state isolation enforced through access control and non-reentrancy checks.  
- As a user, I want to cancel my orders, ensuring only I can modify my order states to prevent unauthorized access.  
- As a contract, I need to validate order signatures and nonces to enforce write isolation and prevent replay attacks.  
- As a trader, I want to ensure token IDs are valid and registered, maintaining state integrity across operations.
