  - As the game creator, I want to initialize the game by setting a question and hashed answer, and be the only one who can stop the game or update the question.  
  - I need exclusive write access to game parameters (`question`, `responseHash`) and withdrawal rights.  
  - As a player, I want to submit answers to the question with >1 ETH to win the contract balance, with guarantees that:  
    - My transaction is processed only if Iâ€™m an EOA (preventing contract exploits).  
    - The answer verification uses an isolated, tamper-proof hash (`responseHash`).  
  - State variables like `questionSender` and `responseHash` must be internally isolated (readable only by the contract) to prevent unauthorized access.
