- As a project owner, I want to set up a fundraising with a goal and deadline, and finalize it to create a token and liquidity pool.
- As a contributor, I want to contribute ETH to the fundraising and receive tokens if the goal is reached, or get a refund if not.
- As a whitelisted user, I want to contribute during the whitelist period with a maximum cap.
- As a public user, I want to contribute (if the project allows public contributions) with a maximum cap per user.
- As the owner or protocol admin, I want to add/remove users from the whitelist and adjust the caps.
- As the protocol admin, I want to perform emergency escape to recover funds in case something goes wrong before finalization.
