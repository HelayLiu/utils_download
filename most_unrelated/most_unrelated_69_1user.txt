- As a user, I deposit LP tokens to earn yield, knowing my funds are isolated from others via the vault.  
- As a keeper, I harvest and compound rewards while ensuring only authorized actors adjust fees.  
- As the owner, I set fees and routes securely, with changes restricted to manager roles.  
- As the strategist, I receive fees without accessing user funds directly.
